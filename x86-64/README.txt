I am trying to learn Assembly in my spare time.  
Should you be curious, you are more than welcome to take a look at what I have learned so far.

This is a sort of Hello, World! program written in x86-64 Assembly.
It requires a Linux environment, including the NASM assembler, and a linker.  The GNU Tools 'ld' is sufficient.

Oh...and 'make'.  Don't forget to use 'make'.

Enjoy!
